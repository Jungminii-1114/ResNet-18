### In this project, we implemented the ResNet-18 architecture from scratch using PyTorch, without relying on pre-defined model libraries.

Due to the file size limit, the dataset files (train.tar, test.tar) are hosted on Google Drive. Please download them from the link below:

[Dataset Setup]

Since the dataset exceeds GitHub's file size limit, it is provided via Google Drive.
Download train.tar and test.tar from the link below.
Place the files in the dataset/ directory (or your project root).
Unzip the files before running the code.
